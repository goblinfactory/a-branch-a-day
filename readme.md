# A Branch a day

Get into the habit of writing and committing code every day. Non stop learning.

Idea: 

- add a new branch each day.
- setup the project on Azure so I have automatic builds.
- write a build script that reads all the branches and updates the readme.md on master with a link to all the branches, sortof a poor mans blog, so that I can easily navigate each.
- have a readme.md.template that has the main readme template, with a few simple tokens that can be updated.
- for now, I'll manually update the readme for a few days, and then create the ops scripts at a later stage.
